# age-and-gender-classification
To process this project I've used here OpenCv. This is the most popular library of Python. I've used here Google Colab. Colab supports many popular and high-level machine learning libraries which can be easily loaded. 

# Input & Output
I've taken 6 sample pictures. All the pictures are different catagories means all these are difference in age and gender.
